# First Thoughts on Static Blogging

## Why Go Static?

After years of dealing with complex CMS platforms, I decided to go back to basics. Static blogs are:
- **Fast**: No server processing needed
- **Secure**: Nothing to hack
- **Reliable**: Works forever
- **Authentic**: Close to the metal

## The Journey

Building theShell was about rediscovering the joy of simple tools:
- A text editor
- Version control
- A deployment platform

No unnecessary complexity, just pure expression.

## What's Next?

This blog is just the beginning. I plan to use it as a space to:
- Share technical learnings
- Document creative projects
- Reflect on digital culture
- Experiment with web technologies

Stay tuned!
