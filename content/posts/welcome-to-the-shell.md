# Welcome to theShell

Welcome to my personal blog! This is where I share thoughts, memories, and digital artifacts preserved in the retro aesthetic.

## What is theShell?

theShell is a personal blog built with the spirit of 8-bit computing nostalgia. Each post is a function call into my memories, and every line of code is a memory stored in binary.

## Why Retro?

There's something magical about the simplicity of old terminals. No distractions, just you and the text. That's the spirit of theShell.

## What to Expect

Here you'll find:
- **Personal reflections** on technology and life
- **Technical deep dives** into interesting problems
- **Creative experiments** combining code and art
- **Digital nostalgia** celebrating the beauty of retro computing

## Getting Started

Feel free to explore the blog, read through posts, and enjoy your stay in this little corner of the internet.

Happy exploring!
