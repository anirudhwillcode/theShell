`Why Depth Matters`

In this blog I wanted to explore the idea of depth. Depth is defined as going so deep into one area that you understand it BETTER THAN 99% of people. When you have depth in something, you don't just know "what" happens — you know why, how, and what if not. It is crucial in anybody's professional life and can be implemented in their professional career too.

I want to take an example of a person named **Linus Torvalds**, the creator of the **Linux kernel**. We will see how depth made him one of the most influential and impactful engineers the world has ever seen.

`Linus Torvalds - The Legend`

Linus Torvalds, born on December 28, 1969, in Helsinki, Finland, is the mastermind behind the Linux operating system.

His journey into computing began early. At just 10 years old, he started experimenting with programming on his grandfather's Commodore VIC-20. Years later, while studying computer science at the University of Helsinki (where he earned his M.S. in 1996), Torvalds bought his first personal computer in 1991.

However, he wasn’t impressed with the operating system it came with—MS-DOS. Torvalds had grown fond of UNIX during his time at the university and wanted the same experience on his own machine. Since no UNIX-like system existed for PCs at that time, he did something extraordinary: he decided to build one himself.

That personal project would eventually become Linux, one of the most influential technologies in modern computing.


`Linux - Open Source Operating System`

Linux is an operating system—just like Windows or macOS—but it's free, open source, and extremely powerful. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 1991.

**Key Points:**

- Open source → anyone can see the code, modify it, or use it freely.

- Secure → very hard to infect with viruses compared to Windows.

- Stable & Fast → used in servers, supercomputers, Android phones, routers, and even space missions.

- Customizable → thousands of “flavors” (called distros) like Ubuntu, Kali, Arch, Parrot, Fedora.

- Used everywhere → 90% of cloud servers and almost all cybersecurity tools run on Linux.

### `The Impact`

Let's understand what open source is first. Just like a cooking recipe that anyone can read, use, change, or improve, open-source software is made with code that anyone can see, use freely, modify, and share. Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and many others are not open source—they make money from customers and keep their code private.

Let's understand the impact of Linus and Linux through an interesting analogy: **If Linux was NOT open source, how rich would Linus Torvalds be?**

Let's answer this with **realistic numbers**, not random fantasy.

### `1. Where Linux is used today`

Linux currently powers:

    - **80%+ of all smartphones (Android kernel)**
    - **96% of the top 1 million servers**
    - **100% of the top 500 supercomputers**
    - **Millions of embedded devices**
    - **Cloud providers (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, Oracle Cloud)**
    - **Routers, TVs, cars, satellites, drones, etc.**

Linux is probably the **most used OS kernel ever created**.

**SCENARIO 1: If Linux Charged for Server Licenses**

Approx. Linux servers worldwide: **35 million** (conservative)

If each paid a **$500 license**:

```35,000,000 × $500 = $17,500,000,000
= $17.5 billion revenue
```

If Linus owned **10% equity** (typical after dilution):

```
10% of $17.5B = $1.75 billion
```

---





**SCENARIO 2: Android Royalties (If the Kernel Were Closed-Source)**

Total Android devices shipped so far: **3.5 billion**

If each device paid **$1 per device**:

```
3,500,000,000 × $1 = $3.5 billion
```

If $2/device → **$7 billion**
If $5/device → **$17.5 billion**

Samsung alone sells 250M phones/year → potential **$250M/year** royalty.

---




**SCENARIO 3: Embedded + IoT + Automotive**

Estimated embedded Linux devices: **25 billion** (routers, smart TVs, vehicles, robots, appliances)

If each paid **$0.20 license**:

```
25,000,000,000 × $0.20 = $5 billion
```

If $1/device → **$25 billion**

---







**SCENARIO 4: Cloud Providers (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure)**

Millions of cloud Linux instances in total.

If Linux licensing cost was similar to Windows Server on cloud:

```
20 million instances × $100/year = $2 billion/year
```

Over 10 years → **$20 billion**

---






**Total (Low Estimate):** ~$46 billion
**Total (High Realistic Estimate):** ~$80–$100 billion

If Linus held **10%** equity:

```
10% of $80B ≈ $8 billion
```

If he somehow kept **50%** equity:

```
50% of $80B ≈ $40 billion
```

---

**Linus Torvalds’ hypothetical net worth if Linux were closed-source:**
**$8 billion to $40+ billion**
(Comparable to founders of Adobe, Zoom, or Spotify.)



`The Importance of Depth`

Now, let us return to the central idea of this blog: **depth**.

When we look at the life and work of Linus Torvalds, one truth becomes very clear — he did not become extraordinary because he tried a hundred different things. He became extraordinary because he went incredibly deep into **one thing**: operating systems and kernel design.

Depth is not about talent. It is about choosing a narrow domain and exploring it with absolute focus, patience, and curiosity until you reach a point where very few people can match your understanding. Depth creates clarity that others do not have. It gives you the ability to solve problems that look impossible to everyone else.

`How Linus Demonstrated Depth`

Linus did not set out to build a global operating system. He simply wanted to understand how systems work at the deepest level. Instead of settling for “using” an OS, he wanted to know:

* Why does the kernel behave this way?
* How does memory actually get managed?
* What happens inside the CPU when a program runs?
* What if the OS was designed differently?

This desire to understand *beneath the surface* is what guided him.

Most people learn enough to use a computer. Some learn enough to configure it. Very few learn how to build the fundamental layers of it. Linus chose the last path — and that depth allowed him to create something that billions rely on today.

`Why Depth Creates Impact`

Depth multiplies impact because:

* **Deep knowledge leads to original solutions**
  Shallow understanding only allows you to copy others. Deep understanding lets you invent.

* **Depth is rare**
  Most people do not persist long enough to reach the top 1%. That scarcity alone creates value.

* **Depth compounds**
  The more you learn in a narrow field, the faster your expertise grows. Each year adds more clarity.

* **Depth builds confidence**
  When you truly understand a topic inside-out, you stop being afraid of problems. You know how to break them down.

Linus built Linux because depth gave him the confidence to attempt something most people would never dare.

`Why Linus Did Not Become a Billionaire — and Why That Is the Point`

We just calculated that Linus *could* have been worth **$8–40 billion** if Linux were closed-source.
But he still chose to open it to the world.

Why?

Because his goal was **not wealth** — his goal was **mastery**.

Depth naturally shifts your mindset:

* From chasing outcomes → to pursuing understanding
* From showing off → to building something meaningful
* From external reward → to internal satisfaction

The world rarely remembers people who chased money. But it always remembers those who chased depth.

`What You Can Learn From This`

You do not need to be a genius.
You do not need ten different skills.
You need **one domain** that you go so deep into that you rise above the noise.

Depth can be:

* Cybersecurity
* Operating systems
* Frontend engineering
* Data science
* Reverse engineering
* UI/UX
* Cloud
* Anything you genuinely care about

The key is to choose **one**, and then:

* Study it deeply
* Break it apart
* Understand its fundamentals
* Build projects in it
* Stay consistent

Depth builds reputation.
Depth builds opportunities.
Depth builds confidence.
And eventually — depth builds wealth, whether or not that was the original goal.

`Conclusion: Depth Is Your Advantage`

Linus Torvalds changed the world not by learning everything, but by mastering one thing.

Depth is not for the impatient.
It is not for those who jump from topic to topic.
It is for those who choose a path and walk it long enough to create an impact.

In an age where everyone is distracted, depth becomes a superpower.
